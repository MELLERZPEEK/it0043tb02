        <p class="desc"> Saitama (サイタマ, Saitama) is the main protagonist of the series and the titular One-Punch Man. He is currently the most powerful being to exist in the series. Saitama faces a self-imposed existential crisis, as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from battle.[7]
            Initially just a hero for fun,[8] Saitama later registers to be a professional hero for the Hero Association[9] upon realizing that nobody recognizes him as a hero, and defends his home in Z-City from monsters, villains, and other threats.[10] Under the Hero Association, he is assigned the hero name Caped Baldy (ハゲマント, Hagemanto; Viz: Bald Cape)[11] and is currently A-Class Rank 39.</p>
